    "## Q1. Refactoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can start coverting our code with tests, we need to refactor it. We'll start by getting rid of all the global variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let's create a function `main` with two parameters: `year` and `month`.\n",
    "* Move all the code (except `read_data`) inside `main`\n",
    "* Make `categorical` a parameter for `read_data` and pass it inside `main`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to create the \"main\" block from which we'll invoke the main function. How does the `if` statement that we use for this looks like?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: after refactoring, check that the code still works. Just run it e.g. for Feb 2021 and see if it finishes successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to run it, you can write results to your local filesystem. E.g. here:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "output_file = f'taxi_type=fhv_year={year:04d}_month={month:02d}.parquet'\n",
